# Hey there 👋

I'm Arno, figuring out this whole "coding" thing one bug at a time.  
Currently exploring Python and C, and occasionally questioning life choices when things don't compile.

## A little about me:  

🔧 Working on: Learning the ropes and building small, functional projects (hopefully).  
🌱 Learning: Python, C, and the fine art of reading error messages without panicking.  
🤝 Open to: Chatting, collaborating on beginner-friendly stuff, or swapping learning tips.  
💬 Fun topic: How code works… and how it *sometimes* just… doesn’t.  
🍵 Fuelled by: Tea and mild stubbornness.  
🦈 Random fact: Sharks have been here for over 400 million years — long before trees… and long after most things are gone.

*"Still learning. Still curious. Probably brewing tea."*
